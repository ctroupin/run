Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to visit Hamburg two times, without any prior idea of where to go.

### <i class="fas fa-shoe-prints"></i> Classic
Looking at the map, it is clear that we have easy options: following the Elbe river, the track was nice, with some stairs if I remember well, and at the end a cool beach. The other clear option was the loop around the 2 artificial lakes, _Binnenalster_ (the small one) and _AuÃŸenalster_. The loop around the 2nd is more than 7 km long. Perfect place for pace training. From the center to the lakes, you can also cross the park _Planten un Blomen_.

### <i class="fas fa-map-signs"></i> _Hors des sentiers battus_
I could not really find something worth mentioning during these two visits, so itâ€™s added on the task list. Iâ€™ve explored the *Hafencity* district a little bit, that was not so fun to run.
